This project is a practice landing page layout designed using Flexbox 🖥️💻. The goal is to experiment and learn the power of CSS Flexbox for building responsive and adaptive layouts. This is not a real, functional landing page 🌐, but rather a mock-up that showcases different layout techniques, such as centering, alignment, and distribution of elements 🎨. It's a great way to dive deeper into Flexbox and enhance front-end development skills 💪✨.
